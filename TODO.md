# RNG State Reverse Engineering - Implementation Plan

## Problem Overview
Determine the original 64-bit PCG RNG state from observable behavior data points. **NEW CONSTRAINT**: The solution is guaranteed to be the result of seeding the RNG with a specific signed 32-bit integer value (i.e., equivalent to using the set-seed function in the CLI).

Each data point contains:
- Offset from original state (accumulated RNG advances)
- Range (min, max) for random number generation
- Observed rounded result (2 decimal places)

### Data Collection Trade-offs
- **Data Collection Cost**: 2 seconds per data point for experienced user
- **Execution Time**: Decreases with more data points (better constraints)
- **Optimization Goal**: Minimize total time = (data points × 2 seconds) + execution time
- **Solution Output**: Recommend optimal number of data points to collect

## Technical Constraints & Analysis

### RNG Implementation Details
- **Generator**: PCG XSH RR 64/32 (64-bit state, 32-bit output)
- **State Space**: ~~2^64 possible states~~ **REDUCED TO 2^32 possible states** (4.3 billion) due to seed constraint
- **Seed Constraint**: Solution must be reachable via `SggPcg::seed(i32_value as u64)`
- **LCG Constants**: MULTIPLIER = 0x5851f42d4c957f2d, INCREMENT = 0xb47c73972972b7b7
- **Output Function**: XSH RR (xorshift high, random rotate)
- **Advance Function**: Efficient O(log n) state jumping

### Data Point Processing
- u32 → fraction: `value / u32::MAX`
- Scale to range: `fraction * (max - min) + min`
- Round to 2 decimals: Creates uncertainty bands
- Multiple data points create constraint system

### Performance Requirements (UPDATED WITH REAL DATA)
- ~~Brute force (2^64 states): Infeasible (~584 years at 1B checks/sec)~~
- **REALITY: Brute force (2^32 states): ~86 seconds actual runtime** (not 4.3s as estimated)
- **Bottleneck**: RNG state computation and constraint validation, not raw iteration
- **Current Performance**: ~50M seeds/second effective (4.3B / 86s)
- **Target**: Reduce to <30 seconds (need 3x speedup)
- **Critical insight**: Complex constraint validation dominates runtime, not seed iteration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **CLI Interface**
   - New subcommand: `cargo run -- reverse-rng input.txt`
   - Input parser for data point format
   - Output original state candidate(s)
   - **Data Point Recommendation**: Suggest optimal number of data points to collect

2. **Data Structures**
   ```rust
   struct DataPoint {
       offset: u64,
       range_min: f64,
       range_max: f64,
       observed: f64,
       name: String, // for debugging
   }
   
   struct StateCandidate {
       state: u64,
       confidence: f64,
       error_metrics: Vec<f64>,
   }
   
   struct TimeOptimization {
       data_points: usize,
       estimated_execution_time: f64,
       total_time_seconds: f64, // collection + execution
   }
   ```

3. **Constraint Analysis**
   - For each data point, calculate possible u32 value ranges
   - Account for rounding errors (±0.005 precision)
   - Create validity checking function for state candidates
   - **Performance Modeling**: Estimate execution time based on constraint strength

### Phase 2: Simplified Search Strategy (Due to Reduced Search Space)

#### Primary Strategy: Direct Brute Force with Early Termination
1. **Seed Space Iteration**: Test all i32 values (-2^31 to 2^31-1)
2. **State Generation**: For each seed, compute `SggPcg::seed(seed as u64)` to get initial state
3. **Constraint Validation**: Verify all data points against the seeded state
4. **Early Termination**: Stop on first invalid data point for each candidate

#### Secondary Strategy: Constraint Pre-filtering (Optional Optimization)
1. **Range Calculation**: For each data point, compute valid u32 ranges
2. **Seed Elimination**: Quickly eliminate impossible seeds before full validation
3. **Parallel Processing**: Test multiple seeds simultaneously

### Phase 3: Performance Optimizations (Now Optional)

#### Simple Optimizations (Low Priority)
1. **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded seed testing
2. **Early Termination**: Skip validation on first constraint failure
3. **SIMD Instructions**: Batch process multiple seeds simultaneously

#### Advanced Optimizations (Likely Unnecessary)
1. **Smart Ordering**: Test more likely seed ranges first (e.g., smaller absolute values)
2. **Constraint Scoring**: Order data points by selectivity
3. **Adaptive Batching**: Adjust chunk sizes based on constraint hit rates

### Phase 4: Testing & Benchmarking Framework

#### Test Data Generation
1. **Known State Tests**: Generate test data from known RNG states
2. **Synthetic Datasets**: Various numbers of data points (1-100)
3. **Edge Cases**: Near-boundary values, minimal precision differences
4. **Adversarial Cases**: Maximum spacing between data points

#### Performance Benchmarks
1. **Accuracy Metrics**: 
   - Success rate for finding correct state
   - Time to first correct candidate
   - False positive rate
2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - States tested per second
   - Memory usage
   - Scaling with number of data points
3. **Time Optimization Analysis**:
   - Execution time vs. number of data points curve
   - Identify optimal data point count for minimum total time
   - Model: `total_time = (data_points × 2) + execution_time(data_points)`

#### Validation Strategy
```rust
fn validate_solution(original_state: u64, data_points: &[DataPoint]) -> bool {
    let mut test_rng = SggPcg::new(original_state);
    for point in data_points {
        test_rng.advance(point.offset);
        let generated = test_rng.next_u32();
        let fraction = generated as f64 / u32::MAX as f64;
        let scaled = fraction * (point.range_max - point.range_min) + point.range_min;
        let rounded = (scaled * 100.0).round() / 100.0;
        if (rounded - point.observed).abs() > 0.005 {
            return false;
        }
    }
    true
}
```

### Phase 5: Advanced Algorithmic Optimizations (REVISED BASED ON ACTUAL PERFORMANCE)

#### CRITICAL: Mathematical Constraint Solving (Potential 10-100x speedup)
1. **Direct Mathematical Elimination**: 
   - Pre-compute impossible seed ranges using mathematical analysis
   - Use constraint algebra to eliminate large ranges without RNG computation
   - Implement u32 range intersection logic for multiple constraints

2. **Interval Arithmetic Approach**:
   - For each data point, compute the mathematical range of seeds that could produce the observed value
   - Use interval intersection to find candidate seed ranges
   - Only test seeds in the intersection of all intervals

3. **Backwards RNG State Computation**:
   - Instead of advancing forward from seed, compute what initial state would produce each observed value
   - Use modular arithmetic to solve for seeds that satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously

#### High-Impact Optimizations (Potential 2-5x speedup)
1. **Constraint Graph Analysis**:
   - Build dependency graph between data points based on offset relationships
   - Use graph algorithms to identify minimal constraint sets
   - Eliminate redundant or dominated constraints

2. **Incremental Validation**:
   - Cache intermediate RNG states for common offset patterns
   - Use memoization for frequently accessed RNG advances
   - Implement delta-based validation for similar seeds

3. **Probabilistic Pre-filtering**:
   - Use statistical analysis to identify highly unlikely seed ranges
   - Implement bloom filters for impossible seed detection
   - Use machine learning to predict seed viability

#### Medium-Impact Optimizations (Potential 1.5-2x speedup)
1. **Memory Layout Optimization**:
   - Optimize data structures for cache locality
   - Use SIMD-friendly data layouts for constraint checking
   - Implement custom allocators for hot path objects

2. **Algorithm-Level Improvements**:
   - Implement binary search over seed ranges where possible
   - Use divide-and-conquer approaches for constraint satisfaction
   - Implement early termination at multiple levels

#### Current Status Analysis
- **Current Performance**: 99.9% early filtering, 86 seconds runtime
- **Primary Bottleneck**: RNG state computation and advance() operations
- **Secondary Bottleneck**: Constraint validation (u32 range checking)
- **Filter Effectiveness**: Very high (99.9%), but remaining 0.1% still takes ~86 seconds
- **Key Insight**: Need to avoid RNG computation entirely for most seeds

- **7 data points**: 14 + 86 = 100 seconds total (current)
- **Target**: 14 + 30 = 44 seconds total (with algorithmic improvements)
